# Hello, World!

This repository hosts projects showcasing learned skills like Python, SQL, Tableau (TBD) on the path to becoming a Data Analyst.

The two main folders are **Guided** Projects and **Personal** Projects.

**Guided** projects contain a predetermined goal and outline as set by the online bootcamp Dataquest.

**Personal** projects use the skills learned in guided projects to create unique ones.
